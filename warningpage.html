		<h1>WARNING</h1>
		<p>Email Disclaimer: An email disclaimer is any disclaimer added to the footer of an email. Make customers aware of your disclaimer. Use at Your Own Risk Disclaimer: Use at your own risk disclaimers instruct your siteâ€™s visitors to act on your content or recommendations at their own risk. Whenever you're sharing information with people that they may actively use or follow, you should include the "use at your own risk" disclaimer so that your business can't be held liable. AFFILIATES DISCLAIMER The Site may contain links to affiliate websites, and we receive an affiliate commission for any purchases made by you on the affiliate website using such links. Most fair use disclaimers use similar language, as can be observed in our examples above. Examples are only used as guides; they should not be used as the exact document that you will follow your own project and risk management. A "use at your own risk" disclaimer is handy for websites or app that share things like recipes, instructions, advice, medical information, articles and more. If you are using a risk disclaimer, then it must be highly visible. In such a case, there is a great risk that your disclaimer becomes annoyingly long.</p>
